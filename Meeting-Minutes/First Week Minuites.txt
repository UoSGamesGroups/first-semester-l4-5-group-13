Tom-absent due to confirmed back injury (pulled muscles earlier in the day), was for there for presentation and knows he is being set tasks.

Presentation Summary:
The monochopsis combined with the procedural generation was well recieved. The Ruckenwhatever was not as strong however. 
Art-wise, it was reccomended to scale down the enviroments. It was also reccomended that we focus on the monochopsis and creating an air of not knowing what will happen next.
